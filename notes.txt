Theorem: F is container iff each slice of El(F) has initial object.
[see Gambino & Cock]

Theorem: F is Qcont iff each slice of El(F) has a transitive object.
[see Hasegawa for analytic functors]
[check proof]

Theorem:
Assume F is small (see Adamek?)
then F is container iff F preserves (wide) pullbacks.
[fix size, either use Adameks or introduce alternative]

Sketch:
=> : easy

<= :

Any functor F : Set -> Set is a coproduct of functors that preserve 1.
For any s : F1 define F s : Set -> Set as Fs X = { x : F x | F ! x = s}. Then 
F X = Sigma s : S. F s X and Fs 1 ~ 1.

F_s preserves pbs (because F does) and 1 hence it preserves all
limits. And hence it is isomorphic to a hom functor (if we assume the
existence of large limits)., i.s. F s X ~ P s -> X.

Theorem:
Assume F is small (see Adamek?)
then F is Qcontainer iff F weakly preserves (wide) pullbacks.

check Adamek's proof. Is this constructive?
[Hasegawa's isn't]

* Generalisation of Quotient Containers
  given by a 
  S : Groupoid
  P : S -> Set (functor)

  We can show that every QCont gives rise to this
  but not vice versa (constructively) since we need the skeleton of S.

  To develop the theory we can systematically replace Pi by Ends and Sigma by Coends. 

  Some issues:
  - how to prove the representation theorem?
     i.e. how to recover the groupoid?
  - Do we get some new examples?
