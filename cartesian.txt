Theorem: 
-------
 Let  F be a container, G  a functor on Set and alpha a cartesian morphism 
 alpha: G -> F. Then G is a container.

Proof:
----
Let FX = [| S <| P |] = Sigma (s:S) (P s -> X)

G is given by  a coproduct of terminal-object preserving functors. Let A=G1
 GX = Sigma (a:A) (G_a X)

alpha is natural, hence it maps each a : A to an s: S through alpha_1 : A -> S.
Since we are working in Set, alpha can be decomposed as a sum of morphisms.
 Sigma (a:A) (G_a X -> P (alpha_1 a) -> X), each of which must be an iso, by the lemma below.
Hence G is a sum of representables, i.e. a container.

Lemma: Given a pullback square
------
         p0
    P ---> A
    |            |  f
    v           v
    B---->B'
          g

Then, if g is an iso, p0 is an iso.

Proof:
-----
Construct h : A -> P using the UP of the pullback on the following span:   
        B <--g^{-1}.f-- A -id--> A
Then p0.h = id.
But, h.p0 must be the identity by uniqueness of the map P->P making the corresponding diagram commute.
